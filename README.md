** This is going to be the game engine of the game "Secret Hitler" we are going to use in order to train our agents.

The game engine still merits a lot of work, and requires some more design changes (i.e how do the players affect the game object? Do they each hold a separate object of the game? That is very much against all solid principles but we will see what we do).
Hopefully tommorow I'll get some more leasure time to spend on this :).
